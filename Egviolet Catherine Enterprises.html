<u><h2>Cassava Farming</h2></u>
<p>Cassava farming is known to be a profitable business and over the years, it has evolved from small scale into a 
global industry in most countries where it is carried out. If you are considering starting a commercial cassava farming business, 
the good news is that you can’t get it wrong. This is because cassava is consumed by both human and livestock in different forms.
It is important to state that starting a cassava farming business comes with its own fair share of challenges, but that does not rule 
out the fact that it is indeed a profitable business venture.
An aspiring entrepreneur can either choose to start a cassava farm on a small scale or on a large scale depending on their financial status.
So, if you have decided to go into cassava farming, then you should ensure that you carry out thorough feasibility studies and also market survey. 
This will enable you properly locate the business in a good location and then hit the ground running. Business plan is yet another very important 
business document that you should not take for granted in the bid to launch your own cassava farming business.
</p>
<br>
<u><h2>Industry Overview</h2></u>
<p>Businesses in the cassava farming industry primarily grow different species of cassava for different purposes. As a matter of fact, worldwide, 
800 million people depend on cassava as their primary food staple especially in Sub – Saharan Africa, South America and some parts of Asia.
Cassava is known to be the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after rice and maize. Cassava is indeed a major staple food
in Africa, providing basic food for over five million people. It is one of the most drought-tolerant crops, capable of growing on marginal
soils. Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of cassava, while Thailand is the largest exporter of dried cassava.
<br>
Cassava is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates.
Although it is often called yucca in Spanish and in the United States, it is important to state that it differs from the yucca, an unrelated fruit-bearing shrub in the Asparagaceae family.
The Cassava Farming Industry is indeed a very large industry and pretty much thriving in countries such as Nigeria, Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia and Republic of the Congo et al. In 2014, 
global production of cassava root was 268 million tones, with Nigeria as the world’s largest producer of nearly 55 million tones or 21 percent of the world total.
As a matter of fact, with the recent advancement in technology, farmers can now comfortably grow crops such as cassava in a country where such crops can hardly survive.
One thing is certain when it comes to commercial cassava farming, if you are able to conduct your market research and feasibility studies before choosing a location for
cultivating your cassava, you are more likely not going to struggle to grow the cassava and also to sell your cassava because there are always food processing companies, 
laundry starch production companies, biofuel production companies, pharmaceutical companies and consumers out there who are ready to buy from you.
Lastly, with commercial cassava farming in the United States, it will pay you not to only cultivate cassava and sell them to manufacturing companies that depend on cassava 
as a major raw material. You can as well start a complimentary business like cassava processing plant; producing and packaging laundry starch, animal feed or any other product 
that can be gotten from cassava. The bottom line is that if you have enough farm land (space) and you are interested in maximizing commercial cassava farming, you are sure going 
to make huge profits from the business.</p>
<br>
<u><h2>Mission</h2></u>
<p>Egviolet Catherine Enterprises is a registered commercial farm that will be based in the outskirts of Dallas,Texas – United States.
We have done our detailed market research and feasibility studies and we were able to secure a well – situated and suitable farm 
land to start our commercial cassava farm.
Our commercial cassava farm is going to be a standard farm hence will be involved in both commercial cassava cultivation, laundry starch
and animal feed production. We will be involved in both organic commercial cassava farming and non – organic commercial cassava farming.
We have put plans in place that will help us launch a standard and world-class cassava processing plant within the first three years of 
officially running Akin Williams® Cassava Farms, Inc. We will produce laundry starch and animal feeds and ensure that they flood the market both in the United States and in other countries of the world.
We want to compete with the best in the industry, which is why aside from the fact that we have secured the required farm land and most of the farming equipment and machines, we have also hired some
key employees who are currently undergoing training so as to fit into the ideal picture of the 21st century commercial cassava farm workforce that we want to build.
We are in the commercial cassava farming business because we want to leverage on the vast opportunities available in the commercial farming industry to contribute 
our quota in growing the U.S. economy, in national food production, raw materials production for industries, to export agriculture produce from the United States 
to other countries and over and above to make profit.
Akin Williams® Cassava Farms, Inc. is well positioned to become one of the leading commercial cassava farms in the United States of America, which is why we have been able to 
source for the best hands and farm machineries to run the farm with.
We have put process and strategies in place that will help us employ best practices when it comes to commercial cassava farming processes and laundry starch and 
animal feeds production as required by the regulating bodies in the United States of America.</p>
<br>

We are in this line of business to make profits, and we will ensure that we do all that is allowed by the law of the United States of America to achieve our business 
goals and objectives. These are the areas we will concentrate on in our commercial cassava farms. If need arises we will definitely cultivate related crops.

<u><h2>Business Partners</h2></u>
<p>
Our business partners are traders, local farmers, manufacturers, dealers
of food stuffs, retailers and consumers.</p>
<br>
<u><h2>Investments</h2></u>
<ul>
<li>Violet Integrated Farms Ltd is already investing in critical infrastructure such as roads within the project area, and is hoping that such investment in 
infrastructure will provide the requisite signals to attract external investors’ participation in the development of the GINGER PRODUCTION 
PROCESSING project. The project will attract top-flight investors using a package of incentives that will be layered and tiered according to 
the quality of the investment that they bring. Additionally, smaller businesses will benefit from an incentives package, which will make GINGER 
Production Processing a preferable option when compared to others. The amenities to be made available from the project include
frastructures, Business office spaces and opportunities,Warehousing for Logistics and Supply Chain Support, Living space for support staff,
developed on site,and Machinery.</li><li>
<br>
</li><li>This ESIA study will therefore,aim to identify potential and significant adverse environmental and social impacts and to propose means of
mitigating them to acceptable levels. The ESIA will also consider the capacity of existing institutions to manage the predicted 
environmental and social issues and implement an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for this purpose. An Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) has been previously carried out for theGINGER PRODUCTION &amp; PROCESSING project. This yielded the commencement
of the delivery of the Phase 1 Primary Engineering Infrastructure. This ESIA study will also upgrade the previous EIA carried out
for the project.</li>
